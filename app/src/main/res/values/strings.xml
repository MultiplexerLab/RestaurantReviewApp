    <string name="aboutus">A restaurant is a place where cooked food is sold to
        the public, and where people sit down to eat it. It is also a place where
        people go to enjoy the time and to eat a meal. Some restaurants are a chain,
        meaning that there are restaurants which have the same name and serve the same
        food.</string>
